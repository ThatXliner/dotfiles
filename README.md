# Dotfiles

My dotfiles.

## Contents

  - `zshrc`: My `~/.zshrc` (why is it a folder? The main file you need to source is actually `zshrc/index.zsh`)
  - `Brewfile`: What I have installed via Homebrew
  - `requirements.txt`: What I have installed via pipx
  - `scripts`
    - `setup`: Install the dotfiles!

May add my Atom configuration in the future.

## Why?

1. [Everyone else is uploading their dotfiles](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles)
2. I want to make an automation script in the future for [ThatXliner/setup](https://github.com/ThatXliner/setup)
3. My `.zshrc` was getting quite messy so I decided to make it in a folder. Then I thought, "why not organize *all* my dotfiles as well?"
